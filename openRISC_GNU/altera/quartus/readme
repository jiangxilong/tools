Altera Quartus tools

These are simply downloaded and installed, but take a long time!

You will want to download the Quartus II Web Edition.

It is recommended using the download manager program as it allows you to select exactly what to install.

The following are example steps to do this:

    Download the Quartus web installer
        If that link doesn't work, go to the Quartus software download page
        Click on Download Linux Version
        Avoid registering to download on the next page by selecting the Get One-Time Access radio button and entering spurious details then clicking the Get One-Time Access button below those boxes.
    Run the web installer, eg
        chmod +x ~/Downloads/altera_installer.external.sh
        ~/Downloads/altera_installer.external.sh
    Click through and select to Download Installation Files from the Internet
    Choose a destination directory of wherever you like, however this guide will assume /opt/altera/12.1.sp1
    In the Products window expand the Device Families tree and tick the Cyclone IV E box - this is the family present on the DE0 Nano.
    (Optional) Deselect the Modelsim-Altera Starter Edition (Free) as it's big and we won't be using it.
    Continue through and have it install.

When it's done, use the following to export the Altera tools to your $PATH:

    echo "# Altera Quartus tools path" >> ~/.bashrc

    echo "export ALTERA_PATH=/opt/altera/12.1sp1" >> ~/.bashrc

    echo "export PATH=\$PATH:\$ALTERA_PATH/quartus/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
